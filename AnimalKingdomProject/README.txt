# 🦁 Animal Kingdom OOP & Data Structures Project

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Data Structures** in C++ using templates, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
AnimalKingdomProject/
│
├── main.cpp
├── AnimalHierarchy.h
├── LinkedList.h
├── BinarySearchTree.h
└── README.txt
```

## 💡 Concepts Covered
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
- Friend classes
- Templates (generic programming)
- Singly Linked List (insert, reverse)
- Doubly Linked List (forward/backward traversal)
- Binary Search Tree (insert, inorder, search)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open a terminal or your IDE (like Code::Blocks or VSCode).
2. Compile using:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o AnimalKingdom
   ./AnimalKingdom
   ```

3. Observe the console output as the program:
   - Displays animals
   - Demonstrates linked list and tree algorithms

## 🧠 Learning Goals
Each structure is written clearly and prints progress as it works, helping you **see** how data structures operate step-by-step.

## 🌿 Extend the Project
You can:
- Add new species by subclassing `Animal`.
- Add new algorithms (like sorting) in linked lists.
- Create an interactive version (menu-based).

Happy coding and learning! 🐯🌳
